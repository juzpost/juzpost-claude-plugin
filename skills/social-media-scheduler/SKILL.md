# Scheduling posts with JuzPost

The user's explicit instructions take priority over this skill. Never schedule, publish or delete without the user's go-ahead in this conversation.

If the JuzPost tools are missing or signed out, follow the `setup` skill first. Do not bring up plans or prices; if a tool refuses with an access message, pass it on as it is.

## Schedule a post

1. **Check the connection.** Call `get_context` for the workspace, its timezone and default posting times, and `blocked[]`. If posting is blocked, pass the message on before collecting any post details.
2. **Pick the accounts.** Call `list_accounts` for account ids, platforms, usernames and health. If the user names a group ("my brand accounts"), call `list_groups`. Skip accounts with `health.status` `needs_reconnect` and say which ones. If there are no accounts, say they are connected at https://www.juzpost.com/dashboard/accounts.
3. **Get the brief.** Ask for anything missing:
   - `type`: `text`, `image`, `video` or `blog` (a WordPress blog post). Never guess it; ask if the user hasn't said.
   - `content` (the caption), and `title` where the platform has one (YouTube, Pinterest, and every blog post).
   - Media, if the type needs it.
   - The time, read in the workspace timezone, or "now".
4. **Check the fit.** For captions, titles or media near a limit, call `get_platform_limits` for the platforms involved.
5. **Platform choices.** A Pinterest account needs a board: call `list_options` with `req_type` `list_board`, ask which one, and pass it as `pinterest` keyed by account id with `board_id`. For a WordPress post type other than a blog post, use `list_post_type`. For Bluesky images or video, ask for alt text for each file and whether a content warning is needed (`bluesky`: `alt_text`, `labels`).
6. **Attach media.**
   - A file the user attached in chat or a public link: `upload_media` (`file` or `url`), keep the `media_key`. A public link can also go straight into `media_urls`.
   - A local file or any video in Claude Code: `create_upload_url`, then PUT the original bytes, unchanged, to `upload_url` with the returned header. Keep the `media_key`.
7. **Confirm.** Show the caption, media, each account (platform and username), any per-account differences, and the time in the workspace timezone. Wait for the user to agree.
8. **Schedule.** One `schedule_post` call creates and schedules the post: `type`, `content`, `title` if needed, `media_keys` or `media_urls`, `account_ids`, either `publish_at` (ISO 8601 UTC, at least 10 minutes ahead) or `publish_now: true`, and an `idempotency_key` so a retry never makes a second post.
   - Different text per account: `account_overrides` keyed by account id (`title`, `description`, `hashtags`); one text for every account of a platform: `channel_overrides` keyed by platform id.
   - Different media or cover per account: `media_by_account`, `cover_by_account`.
   - Different time per account: `publish_at_overrides` keyed by account id.
   - Platform settings: `tiktok`, `pinterest`, `facebook`, `bluesky`, `wordpress`, each keyed by account id.
9. **Report.** Call `get_post` and show each account's status. Refer to the post by its caption or title and to accounts by platform and username, not by id.

To save a draft without scheduling, use `create_post` with the same fields, and schedule it later with `schedule_post` and its `post_id`.

## Existing posts

- `list_posts` filters by `status` (`draft`, `scheduled`, `published`, `failed`), `accountId`, and `from`/`to`; `sort: "scheduledFor"` orders by publish time.
- `update_post` edits a draft or a scheduled post. `publish_at` on a scheduled post moves it to a new time. A scheduled post can no longer be edited from 10 minutes before it goes out, and published or failed posts can't be edited.
- A scheduled post can't be cancelled from Claude; the user cancels it in the JuzPost dashboard at https://www.juzpost.com/dashboard/scheduled.
- `delete_post` deletes a draft only. Confirm with the user first. It never removes anything already published on a platform.
- For a failed post, `get_post` gives each account's error; explain it in plain words.

## Limits

- A workspace can create 30 posts per hour through a connector.
- How far ahead a post can be scheduled is `limits.scheduleAheadDays` in `get_context`.
